### First Semester:
List the projects/assignments you completed in the first semester with [hyperlinks](./Static-Website). Also, mention the technologies and skills you acquired e.g.
- Design and implementation of a [static website](./Static-Website) using HTML and CSS. We learned about responsive web design, wireframes, a wide variety of selectors css, plenty of tags in html.

- Mathématiques pour l'informatique (Math for programming) [problem solving reflection](./Problem-Solving-Reflection)
- Hardware and Operating Systems. We learned about the components of a computer, how to use the command line, batch files and also how to make an order for a client.
- Programming I. We learned how to make a fortune teller program using math, we also learned how to make a miniature game where we had to accept input and changed the result depending on said inputs. We also made a camping booking system that takes input and try catches.
- Linear algebra and Vector Geometry. Learned how to do most simple linear algebra such as Gaussian elimination, Cramer's rule, Leontief input-output models, eigenvectors/eigenvalues, etc.

### Second Semester:
List the projects/assignments you completed in the second semester with [hyperlinks](./Dynamic_Website). Also, mention the technologies and skills you acquired e.g.
- Design and implementation of a [dynamic website](./Dynamic_Website)
